          Hello, I'm <strong>Harshal Vaidya</strong>, a software engineer with a

          Technology, graduating with a stellar GPA of <strong>3.9/4</strong>.
          My professional experience spans dynamic roles, including my current
          position as a Software Engineer at Radiance Technologies. There, I
          have enhanced subscription-based systems, redesigned web applications
          for improved user engagement, and optimized deployment pipelines using

          I have also undertaken challenging projects that showcase my
          problem-solving abilities and technical expertise. Notable examples
          include Crypto Trading View, a real-time cryptocurrency data
          visualization platform built with <strong>React</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>WebSockets</strong>, and House of Books, where I implemented
          advanced caching techniques and <strong>Redux</strong> for seamless
          state management. Additionally, during my tenure at Breathing.ai, I
          championed accessibility by achieving <strong>WCAG</strong> compliance
          and improving usability for disabled users.

          Beyond my technical expertise, I have contributed to the community as
          a Graduate Peer Leader at Stevens Institute, mentoring fellow students
          and fostering collaborative learning. With a skill set that includes
          <strong> React, Node.js, AWS,</strong> and <strong>Docker</strong>,
