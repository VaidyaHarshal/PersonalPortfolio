                        Hello, I'm Harshal Vaidya, a versatile software engineer
                        with a passion for crafting innovative solutions. My
                        journey is marked by academic excellence, professional
                        achievements, and a commitment to staying at the
                        forefront of technology.
                    </p>
                    <p className='hero--section--description'>
                        I hold a Master's in Computer Science from Stevens
                        Institute of Technology, where I maintained a GPA of
                        3.9/4. My professional journey includes a tenure as a
                        Software Engineer at 3i-Infotech. There, I optimized
                        performance, achieved significant investment growth, and
                        developed critical monitoring systems.
                    </p>
                    <p className='hero--section--description'>
                        I've undertaken challenging projects that showcase my
                        problem-solving abilities. Notable examples include
                        'House of Books,' demonstrating my proficiency in Redis
                        and automated hosting, and 'Stevens Care,' highlighting
                        my real-time communication skills with Socket.IO. Beyond
                        my technical expertise, I've contributed to the academic
                        community as a Graduate Peer Leader at Stevens
                        Institute, providing mentorship and support to fellow
                        students.
